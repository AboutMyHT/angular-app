\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection{Scope}

We will construct a cross-platform web application that allows users to check on a variety of data points for their locale. This data may include, but is not limited to, gas prices, current and forecast weather, restaurant/food prices, public facilities, local businesses, and possibly crime information. The goal is to compile as much data from public or low-cost API's into a single interface, adding statistical analysis, and overlaying it into a mapping application (such as Google Maps). As a long-term goal we would like to interpret and nd news articles relating to an area of interest, and pin the location in which they took place on the map.

\subsubsection{Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Application:} The web application we are building, which will be called "About My Home Town"
    \item \textbf{API:} Application Programming Interface
    \item \textbf{Authenticated User:} A user who has created an account and logged in
    \item \textbf{Bcrypt:} A password hashing function
    \item \textbf{HTTP:} Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    \item \textbf{HTTPS:} Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
    \item \textbf{JSON:} JavaScript Object Notation
    \item \textbf{Local Storage:} A method of storing data in the user's browser
    \item \textbf{Non-Authenticated User:} A user who has not logged in
    \item \textbf{RESTful API:} A type of API that follows the REST architectural style
    \item \textbf{Salt:} A random value that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data
    \item \textbf{Session Token:} A unique token generated when a user logs in, which is used to authenticate the user
    \item \textbf{User:} The end user of the application
    \item \textbf{Widget:} A small unit of data presentation, containing a sample of data we provide (ex. Weather Widget, Restaurant Widget, etc.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{General Description}

\subsubsection{Product Perspective}

The application we are building will be useful for users who want to access a wide range of data points for their locale in a single interface. This comprehensive approach saves users time and effort by eliminating the need to visit multiple websites or applications to gather this information. By building this application, we are addressing the need for a centralized platform that provides users with a wealth of localized information, ultimately making it easier for them to make informed decisions and navigate their surroundings.

\subsubsection{Product Functions}

This application will aggregate data from various public free and paid sources into a single interface. It will allow users to save their data by logging in and creating an account with their zip code, and then it will show them information regarding their local area, such as weather and restaurant information.

\subsubsection{User Characteristics}

Our prospective users are people who are interested in accessing a range of data points for a given area, such as users looking to move into a new area, users who are traveling, or users who are simply curious about their current surroundings and want to explore. The thing all of these users have in common is that they are looking for a centralized platform that provides them with a wealth of localized information.

\subsubsection{General Constraints}

This has to be built as a web application with constant network access, meaning that it necessarily \textit{cannot} work offline. Due to this, the end user must access our application through a web browser that supports modern JavaScript features.

Another constraint of this is that the data we are pulling in is only as good as the data we are given. If a data source is inaccurate, our application will be inaccurate as well.

\subsubsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}

There are few assumptions from the end user, though as mentioned above, we will assume both that the end user is accessing from a modern web browser and that the data we are pulling in is accurate.
